On this project, I will be working on a dataset about 2022-2023 football transfer season. 

There are interesting questions I would be looking to solve. Find the questions below.


What is the average player market value by country playing in?
What is the most common player position in the dataset?
Which club has paid the most fees for player transfers?
What is the average age of players being transferred?
Which league has the highest number of players being transferred?
What is the average fee paid for players by country moving to?
What is the most common country that players moving to?
What is the most common league that players are moving to?
Which player was bought for the highest fee?

Predicting whether a player will move to a different league or stay in the same league based on their age, market value, position, and country playing using a  logistic regression which is part of classification model .

What is the correlation between player age and fees paid?

Testing whether there is a significant relationship between a player's age and their market value. This can be done using a linear regression model.
